# Python Learning Journey 🐍

A comprehensive collection of Python projects, exercises, and practice programs created during my learning journey. This repository tracks my progress from basic syntax to advanced concepts, recursive algorithms, and problem-solving logic.

Each program represents a step in improving my logical thinking, coding skills, and understanding of Python fundamentals.

## 🚀 About This Repository

This repo contains **all Python programs I’ve written**, starting from the basics and gradually moving toward:

- Recursion and advanced logic  
- Pattern printing and mathematical programs  
- String manipulation and conversions  
- Mini-projects combining multiple concepts  

Every program may seem simple, but each one helped strengthen a specific concept or problem-solving skill.

## 🎯 My Goal

To **build a strong Python foundation** by writing clean, logical, and well-structured code from scratch.  

Each program pushed here is a step toward:

- Improving logical thinking  
- Mastering problem-solving techniques  
- Preparing for Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)  

---

## 🔜 Next Steps

- Master **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**  
- Solve coding challenges on **LeetCode / HackerRank**  
- Explore Python libraries: `math`, `random`, `os`, `datetime`  
- Build mini-projects: calculators, games, file manipulators  
- Learn **OOP (classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation)**  
- Work with **modules, packages, and file handling**
